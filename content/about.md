My name is Teresa Portela. I've held many jobs, from help desk support, system administration, to Information Security. I currently work as part of the Security Engineering team within the Information Security Office at the University of Arizona. 

I devote a lot of my time to projects outside of the infosec world, and I love to give back to the community.
